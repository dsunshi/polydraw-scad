## Todo

- [ ] Combine/simplify sequential calls to `translate`
- [ ] Add ability to round to the multiple of another number to roundDouble
- [ ] Is `intVDouble` and `intVVDouble` really the best way to do it?
- `meshHeight`
    - [ ] Rename to height
    - [ ] Implementable for `union`, `up`, or `stack`?
- [ ] How to deal with r/d shadowing?
- [ ] `prismoid` `[Double]` to `V2 Double` (type alias?)
