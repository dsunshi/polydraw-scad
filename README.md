# Graphics.Polydraw

[![Built with Nix][builtwithnix-badge]][builtwithnix]

## Origin from Graphics.Polydraw

Polydraw is primarily a fork of the brilliant [Graphics.OpenSCAD](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/OpenSCAD-0.2.1.0/docs/Graphics-OpenSCAD.html).
It has been updated to more modern versions of Haskell (as well as my personal opinions). This project is in
very early stages and is subject to change.

### How?
This library provides an algebraic data type for describing [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) models, and a function
that converts that data type into a string.
